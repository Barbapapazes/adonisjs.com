## Describe the project for which you are using AdonisJS

Cavai Creative Cloud is relatively complex tools for building, monitoring and optimizing creatives in the world of interactive advertising

## How has AdonisJS helped you in this project or at your company?

We migrated from legacy non-documented home-grown framework that was based on Express. Maintainance and bug fixing were hell, not to mention there was no documentation about anything. Endless hours of digging inside codebase to figure out how it worked.
