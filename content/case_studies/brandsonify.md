## Describe the project for which you are using AdonisJS

In our projects we mostly use AdonisJS with:

- MySQL or Postgres as a database service.
- ReactJS (SPA app with react-router and redux).
- VueJS (SPA app with Vue-router and Pinia).
- TailwindCSS with Sass.
- Webpack Encore for asset compilation (Waiting for the official Vite support in the framework then we will switch to Vite).
- Soon will implement socket.io for real-time data synchronization. 

## How has AdonisJS helped you in this project or at your company?

I have expertise in the Laravel PHP framework. I recently switched to this company and they wanted me to work with NodeJS. Adonis JS helped me to work with NodeJS without leaving the comfort of Laravel Framework (Two days of study was enough for me to get started with Adonis JS). Recently Japa testing framework was added to Adonis JS and It was a great addition to the framework for me because it made the testing very easy and have a very less learning curve.
