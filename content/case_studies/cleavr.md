## Describe the project for which you are using AdonisJS

We are using AdonisJS for the Cleavr.io backend and VueJS/InertiaJS for the frontend. 

## How has AdonisJS helped you in this project or at your company?

AdonisJS has helped immensely first and foremost as a framework that provides a great starting point and one that easily allows us to customize and enrich for what we are looking to accomplish. Secondarily, having a front-end and back-end all written in the same language allows the team to function more effectively as full-stack developers that can handle working through each layer of the app. 

## What are your thoughts on the AdonisJS developer experience?

Less context shifting between front-end and back-end since they both use JS/TS. I'm sure Ashok can provide better insight; but in general it seems like our team has enjoyed AdonisJS and have found the community to be helpful and engaging when questions on our side arise. 

## What is the one thing you like most about AdonisJS?

I like to see that it is growing and how excited people are when they find out that there is an awesome Node framework available for them to use and quickly / easily build their apps on. There are certainly a lot of other node-based options but none as full-featured and as quality.
